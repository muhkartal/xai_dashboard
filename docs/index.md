## Introduction

The **XAI (Explainable AI) Dashboard** is designed to showcase how a classification model can be trained, evaluated, and explained, all in a user-friendly interface. The project uses popular Python libraries for data science (pandas, scikit-learn), explainability (SHAP or LIME), and dashboard creation (Streamlit).

**Key Goals**:

-  Provide an interactive dashboard for both **model predictions** and **insightful explanations** of those predictions.
-  Demonstrate best practices in **MLOps**, including containerization (Docker) and continuous integration (CI) with GitHub Actions.
-  Offer a clear, modular codebase thatâ€™s easy to maintain, extend, and test.

## Core Features

-  **Classification Model**: By default, a Random Forest classifier is demonstrated on a simple dataset (e.g., Iris), but you can swap in your own data.
-  **Explainability**: Local explanations for individual predictions (e.g., SHAP force plots, summary bars) plus potential global metrics.
-  **Dashboard**: A Streamlit-based UI that allows users to:
   -  Input custom feature values.
   -  See model predictions and confidences.
   -  Visualize explanation plots in real-time.
-  **Testing & CI**: Automated tests (pytest) ensure code reliability, integrated with a GitHub Actions pipeline.
-  **Containerization**: Dockerfile for easy deployment.
